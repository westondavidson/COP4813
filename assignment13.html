  <h3>Creating a Game in Javascript</h3>
  <p>This assignment tasked the class with creating a game in javascript using an engine of our choice. I chose to use Phaser 3, a versatile 2d
    Javascript-based engine.
    <br/><br/>This project is still in development, see below the game for a list of upcoming planned features/additions to the game, as well as current features I'm happy with.

    <br/> <br/>
    <h1>Game Title: Look Out Below!</h1>
  <div id="game"> </div>
  </p>
<p>
  <h1>Upcoming Features/Additions</h1>
  <ul>
    <li> Sprites for the player character and falling objects </li>
    <li> Animations for falling objects and player movement, as well as UI elements </li>
    <li> Updated start screen with easier to read instructions/UI and overall design</li>
    <li> In-game "shop" where players spend score points to increase movement speed, add health, etc. </li>
    <li> Music/SFX </li>
    <li> Additional difficulty increase the longer the game goes </li>
  </ul>
  <br/>
  <h1>Features I'm happy with</h1>
  <ul>
    <li> Parralax background scrolling </li>
    <li> In-game physics engine manipulation </li>
    <li> Scene transitions </li>
    <li> Object rendering/destroying based on camera view </li>
    <li> Working Collision (used to detect when object hits player character) </li>
  </ul>
</br>
  These features are very manageable, with the exception of the in-game shop. The shop might take a while to program with my current knowledge of Phaser 3. I plan to continue to study the engine for the forseeable future to
   improve my Javascript under the guise of something that's very interesting to me.
