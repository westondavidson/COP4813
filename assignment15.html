  <h3>Course Summary: How this Class has Prepared Me for Future Employment</h3>
  <p>
    Over the course of this class, I have picked up on a large amount of the fundamental knowledge needed to be successful in a web development position. Learning the basics of tools like JSON, web hosting, FTP, and submission forms (as well as, of course, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS), have all contributed to my ability to understand some of the more basic functions that a position in front-end web development might involve. While I have felt that I have learned quite a bit about different HTML elements and ways of manipulating websites using JavaScript, I feel that there is still much to learn about being a web developer. <br/><br/>
    After having researched some front-end development positions, many companies would like their developers to be ‚Äúfull-stack‚Äù, meaning that they understand and have a grasp on an entire stack of development tools for both front and back-end application/web development. Being a specialist in only front or backend development doesn‚Äôt cut it in today‚Äôs competitive market.<br/><br/>
    Luckily, there is one stack in particular that I find very interesting, and something I could see developers and companies moving towards in the future: MEAN. MEAN, consisting of MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS, and Node.js, is built entirely on JavaScript, meaning that JS is the only required language to understand the entire operating environment.<br/><br/>
    This stack excites me, as I see it as a style of development that could become very valuable to understand shortly. Being that the stack is entirely constructed of JS-related tools, is entirely open-source, has pretty strong documentation as-is, and streamlines development and deployment (as most applications are technically simplified, packaged websites), I see this stack as being the future of web-app development. Some of the most popular apps used today use MEAN (as well as Electron) for their deployment, like Discord and some versions of Visual Studio.<br/><br/>
    Unfortunately, I‚Äôve already taken the cybersecurity specialization classes during my time here at DSC, but if I could do it over, I would have taken the web development route instead, as I‚Äôm now more interested in this world than the world of cybersecurity. I‚Äôm very fortunate, however, to have a nifty link on hand for Dr. Eaglin‚Äôs Web Systems II course, which I‚Äôll be ‚ÄúAuditing‚Äù during my next, and final semester here at Daytona State üòâ. I would like to continue working on my skills as a web systems programmer, and hopefully put those skills to use for a full-time position once I graduate from school here, which I believe is very feasible based on the requirements of entry-level programming positions I have researched online.
