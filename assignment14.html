  <h3>Creating a Game in Javascript - Updated Game</h3>
  <p>This assignment tasked the class with creating a game in javascript using an engine of our choice. I chose to use Phaser 3, a versatile 2D
    Javascript-based engine. This assignment is a continuation of Assignment 13, in which the class updated their games with new mechanics/polish for resubmission.
    <br/><br/>This project is still in development, see below the game for a list of upcoming planned features/additions to the game, as well as current features I'm happy with.

    <br/> <br/>
    <h1>Game Title: Look Out Below!</h1>
  <div id="game"> </div>
  </p>
<p>
  <h1>Upcoming Features/Additions</h1>
  <ul>
    <li> Sprites for the player character and falling objects - Completed in new iteration</li>
    <li> Animations for falling objects and player movement, as well as UI elements - Completed in new iteration</li>
    <li> Updated start screen with easier to read instructions/UI and overall design - Completed in new iteration</li>
    <li> In-game "shop" where players spend score points to increase movement speed, add health, etc. </li>
    <li> Music/SFX - Music added, additional SFX to be added in the near future </li>
    <li> Additional difficulty increase the longer the game goes </li>
  </ul>
  <br/>
  <h1>Features I'm happy with</h1>
  <ul>
    <li> Parralax background scrolling </li>
    <li> In-game physics engine manipulation </li>
    <li> Scene transitions </li>
    <li> Object rendering/destroying based on camera view </li>
    <li> Working Collision (used to detect when object hits player character) </li>
  </ul>
</p>
</br>
<p>
  These features are very manageable, with the exception of the in-game shop, which may take longer to program. With this iteration of the game I updated the player physics to be more realistic, added animations for the character model,
  made the floor itself scroll with the player to simulate a running effect, updated the UI, wrote and implemented a short chiptune-esque song for the background of gameplay, and added sprites and animations to the falling objects/animals. There are still bugs I want to fix and game mechanics I would like to implement/update. I will continue to work on this project until I'm happy with the results!
